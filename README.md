# SimpleOne Night | A Dark Theme for Discourse 2.0

> After 2 years (scary), I finally got time to update this theme!
Over the time I developed a new theme based on that, which I migrated now to Alien Night. 
I hope you like it!

## Installation
https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-do-i-install-a-theme-or-theme-component/63682

Basically pretty easy and straight forward:

1. Go to Admin
2. Customize
3. Themes
4. Import
5. From the web > github repro URL:
https://github.com/B-iggy/alien-night-discourse-dark-theme
6. Adjust as you wish. A Color Scheme is inclusive

## Additional feature: Theme Switcher
Included is a theme switcher at the top Discourse Header where people can choose between a Light (default) Theme and this Dark theme.
I set a global modifier class in the html and store it in the local Storage. 
This way it is permanent and can react properly.

## Work in Progress

Since Discourse has dynamic and a lot of classes there might be still some contrast issues here and there.
Please create an Issue for that or write in the Forum topic about it and I'll try to fix it as soon as possible! :)
